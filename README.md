# Codewars
A repository filled with the Codewars challenges (katas) I solved. Solving one challenge a day at least. 
You can find my Codewars profile <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/franciscocasillas">here</a>.

## How It's Made
  <b>Tech used:</b> Javascript

## Optimizations
I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability. 

## Lessons Learned:
The biggest lesson anyone can take from Codewars is persistance. I might not know how to solve a problem today but if I keep studying and keep practicing, I will eventually solve it easily. I frequently revisit the challenges I wasn't able to solve at some point in the past, and I get surprised at how easily I can solve them now. So just keep grinding.
